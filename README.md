# Devoter

DEVoter is a warpcast miniapp and webapp helps open source web3 repo maintainers promote their repositories (so that eventually it can be added on scoutgame). At the same time other DEV holders can vote for their preferred choice using DEV tokens. All DEV tokens are held securely during the voting period and then returned after the voting period ends (with a small fee for gas and other cost).
